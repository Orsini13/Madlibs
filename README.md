this is my first java project, b4 i was able to get this done, i watched one tutorial video on java by code with mosh but meanwhile that was not all.
after watching the tutorial video, i looked up on simple projects to try out, then i used giraffe academy's tutorial video to get this project done.
i got to learn about "scanner" which allows the user to put in desired inputs at the terminal
